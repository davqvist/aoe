[tips-and-tricks-item-description]
aoc-tat-aoc=Welcome to Age of Creation, the mod that leads you through several ages of progression, each tied to a specific theme. This mod not only introduces lots of new unique mechanics, but also changes vanilla mechanics, so never assume anything. Investigate careful and/or check this guide regularly to receive tips and tricks. Thanks for playing, have fun.
aoc-tat-science-01=You start out in this age. First you should setup [item=iron-plate] and [item=aoc-glass] automation before worrying about research. Use multiple [entity=burner-mining-drill], [entity=burner-crusher] and [entity=stone-furnace] for that. Just as a heads-up, the [entity=stone-furnace] is changed to a 3x3 footprint. Make use of direct insertion as you don't have access yet for [entity=transport-belt]. [entity=burner-inserter] uses no power and transfers 0.5 items/second. To fuel your machines you have to cut down [item=wood] for now and process it into [item=aoc-charcoal].\n\nNext, to have a constant supply of fuel and to be able to do research you need to automate [item=wood]. You need 3 buildings to fully automate the process:\nFirst craft a [item=tree-seed] and an [entity=agricultural-tower]. After the trees have been fully grown, they will yield [item=aoc-log] and [item=aoc-leaves]. With your [entity=aoc-greenhouse] you can then automate cheaper [item=tree-seed]. Finally, the [entity=aoc-burner-sawmill] can process [item=aoc-log] into [item=wood].\n\nLater you will unlock your first plant [item=aoc-kelp]. All plant farm buildings like the [entity=aoc-farm-reservoir] can take respective plant modules to make the growth process more effective. Even though the modules are technically not required per se, breeding them is highly advised. All plant modules come in 5 tiers, depicted by their rarity of acquiring them. So for kelp it would be in increasing rarity: [item=aoc-kelp-module-1], [item=aoc-kelp-module-2], [item=aoc-kelp-module-3], [item=aoc-kelp-module-4], [item=aoc-kelp-module-5]. Sometimes, like with [item=aoc-flax] there might be multiple different modules of the same rarity.\n\nThen, [entity=aoc-rubber-tree-plant] farms work similar to normal tree farms, just that there are no natural [entity=aoc-rubber-tree-plant] to be found while exploring. With the [entity=aoc-burner-gene-lab] you can make [item=aoc-rubber-tree-seedling] and plant them with your [entity=agricultural-tower] just like normal trees. Be careful to not cut them down as you will only get your seed back, insteaqd tpping [entity=aoc-rubber-tree-plant] for [fluid=aoc-latex] or [entity=tree-plant] for [item=aoc-resin] is a chance-based recipe and depends on the number of trees in the area, but doesn't cut the tree down, so you won't have to continuously grow more trees.
aoc-tat-science-02=Age 2 unlocks power. There are a few things to notice when setting up your first steam power. The ratio is 1 [entity=boiler] to 4 [entity=steam-engine]. Also Age of Creation depends on the Power Overload mod (check also the Power Overload Tips and Tricks). Basically, power poles like the [entity=small-electric-pole] have a max power consumption. If you exceed the power consumption, poles get constantly damaged. You can use entity=po-small-electric-fuse and entity=po-transformer to segregate sections of your base or use higher tiered power poles to increase the max power consumption allowed.\n\n[entity=inserter] and [entity=long-handed-inserter] are twice as fast, but they use power now.\n\nWind Power is the next available power source. It is not fully passive power as you need to replace the rotor regularly, but rotors last a long time. The amount of power you get fluctuates with the available wind, but averages 1MW. Wind power is prioritized to consume over steam power.\n\nThe rock cycle is required to get other metals than iron and copper. You can either use the [entity=aoc-strainer] to get all 3 stone types ([item=aoc-stones-igneous], [item=aoc-stones-sedimentary] and [item=aoc-stones-metamorphic]) equally or melt [item=stone] down to [fluid=lava] using the [entity=aoc-melter] and cool it down using the [entity=aoc-freezer] to turn them all into [item=aoc-stones-igneous]. No matter the initial method, you can use various machines like the [entity=aoc-sedimenter] or [entity=aoc-high-pressure-heater] to switch between the stone types depending on your need.\n\nClose to reaching Age 3, you can breed your first animal: [item=raw-fish]. Animal breeding works pretty much exactly like plant breeding, with one exception. Certain recipes like the ones getting [item=aoc-fish-eggs] have a certain low percentage killing the worst animal module in the machine on completion. See recipe description to see the respective percentages.
aoc-tat-science-03=The other animals work just like [item=raw-fish], just that the low percentage killing the worst animal module changes for each animal. A second reminder to read recipe description to see the respective percentages. Also keep in mind that you can't automate insertion of modules with inserters, only bots can do that. So either wait putting animal modules into those recipes until you have bots or do it manually for now.
aoc-tat-science-04=The rock cycle gets more involved in Age 4. Now the three stone types can be further broken down which is required to unlock further metals.\n\nThe [entity=aoc-fuel-burning-generator] can burn any liquid or gas with a fuel value.\n\nThe next tier of metal processing requires more steps and results in [item=aoc-slag] and [fluid=aoc-tailings] waste products which can't be voided. Research both respective researches to be able to process them further. Also, when you setup your metal processing chains, you may want to plan ahead for the [entity=aoc-metallurgy-beacon]. It needs an upkeep cost of 1 research of the respective metal (e.g. [item=aoc-iron-research] for iron) per minute to boost the productivity of every building that processes that metal by 5% (each of the 6 processing steps). So leave room in the center of each metal processing area for a 5x5 building with a range of effect of 25.\n\nIntricate items like the circuit parts you unlock at the end of the age, have to be made in [entity=assembling-machine-3] and can all be fed with Vacuum to boost the productivity by 10%.
aoc-tat-science-05=This age adds two big challenges: Petrochem processes and bees. For the [entity=aoc-distillation-tower] which produces a lot of liquids which in turn most can be processed further make good use of the [entity=configurable-valve]. You can use [entity=pump] and the circuitry network to similar and more granular effect. Bees work just like every animal, but allow for nearly free production (only cost is a bit of [fluid=aoc-solvent]) of basic resources and are mostly optional (basic bees are required for early bots). Frames like [item=aoc-frame-untreated] help with some processes, check their description on what they do. In the [entity=aoc-inoculator] you can cross-breed new bee types.\n\nAt the end of the age, two further big things open up. First off is lightning power which can provide a huge amount of passive energy if you pay the upfront cost of the [entity=aoc-lightning-rod] itself, [entity=aoc-weather-station], [entity=aoc-transmitting-station] and [entity=accumulator]. You need to a lot of [entity=accumulator] to store the big bursts of energy, you need [entity=aoc-weather-station] if you want to increase the amount of power each strike provides, you need [entity=aoc-transmitting-station] to reduce the time interval between each strike. As the area of influence of the [entity=aoc-lightning-rod] is limited, a good balance of each of those 3 buildings is needed.\n\nThe second thing is the [entity=aoc-infusion-table] as a start into the next age. Place it and 4 [entity=aoc-infusion-pedestal] around it, one in each cardinal direction at maximum distance of the highlighted area. The [entity=aoc-infusion-table] recipes always need 4 ingredients which you need to put into all the [entity=aoc-infusion-pedestal] around it. When the craft is finished, the output is in the [entity=aoc-infusion-table] inventory.
