aoe-tat-aoe=Welcome to Age of Engineering, the mod that leads you through several ages of progression, each tied to a specific theme. This mod not only introduces lots of new unique mechanics, but also changes vanilla mechanics, so never assume anything. Investigate careful and/or check this guide regularly to receive tips and tricks. Thanks for playing, have fun.
aoe-tat-science-01=You start out in this age. First you should setup [item=iron-plate] and [item=aoe-glass] automation before worrying about research. Use multiple [entity=burner-mining-drill], [entity=aoe-burner-crusher] and [entity=stone-furnace] for that. Just as a heads-up, the [entity=stone-furnace] is changed to a 3x3 footprint. Make use of direct insertion as you don't have access yet for [entity=transport-belt]. [entity=burner-inserter] uses no power and transfers 0.5 items/second. To fuel your machines you have to cut down [item=wood] for now and process it into [item=aoe-charcoal].\n\nNext, to have a constant supply of fuel and to be able to do research you need to automate [item=wood]. You need 4 buildings to fully automate the process:\n1.) It's probably best to start with the [entity=aoe-forestry]. Place it down near a forest to physically cut down trees and get your first [item=aoe-log] and [item=aoe-leaves]. The process is not guaranteed and depends on the amount of trees in its radius.\n2.) Then setup your [entity=aoe-greenhouse] in your new permanent area to get [item=aoe-tree-seedling] (which can also be crafted from lots of [item=wood] if necessary).\n3.) Next up, place a [entity=aoe-tree-farm] nearby to physically plant trees in its radius. As with the [entity=aoe-forestry], the process is chance-based and depends on the open space in its radius. Now you can move your [entity=aoe-forestry] to your new farm to cut the trees down as they get planted.\n4.) Finally, the [entity=aoe-burner-sawmill] can process [item=aoe-log] into [item=wood].\n\nLater you will unlock your first plant [item=aoe-kelp]. All plant farm buildings like the [entity=aoe-farm-reservoir] can take respective plant modules to make the growth process more effective. Even though the modules are technically not required per se, breeding them is highly advised. All plant modules come in 5 tiers, depicted by their rarity of acquiring them. So for kelp it would be in increasing rarity: [item=aoe-kelp-module-1], [item=aoe-kelp-module-2], [item=aoe-kelp-module-3], [item=aoe-kelp-module-4], [item=aoe-kelp-module-5]. Sometimes, like with [item=aoe-flax] there might be multiple different modules of the same rarity.\n\nThen, [entity=aoe-rubber-tree] farms work similar to normal tree farms, just that there are no natural [entity=aoe-rubber-tree] to be found while exploring. With the [entity=aoe-burner-gene-lab] you can make [item=aoe-rubber-tree-seedling] and plant them with your [entity=aoe-tree-farm] just like normal trees. Be careful to not cut them down as you will only get normal [item=wood] from them. Tapping [entity=aoe-rubber-tree] for [fluid=aoe-latex] is also chance-based and depends on the number of [entity=aoe-rubber-tree] in the area, but doesn't cut the tree down, so you won't have to continuously breed more [item=aoe-rubber-tree-seedling].
aoe-tat-science-02=Age 2 unlocks power. There are a few things to notice when setting up your first steam power. The ratio is 1 [entity=boiler] to 4 [entity=steam-engine]. Also Age of Engineering depends on the Power Overload mod (check also the Power Overload Tips and Tricks). Basically, power poles like the [entity=small-electric-pole] have a max power consumption. If you exceed the power consumption, poles get constantly damaged. You can use [entity=po-small-electric-fuse] and [entity=po-transformer] to segregate sections of your base or use higher tiered power poles to increase the max power consumption allowed.\n\nWind Power is the next available power source. It is not fully passive power as you need to replace the rotor regularly, but rotors last a long time. The amount of power you get fluctuates with the available wind, but averages 1MW. Wind power is prioritized to consume over steam power.\n\nThe rock cycle is required to get other metals than iron and copper. You can either use the [entity=aoe-strainer] to get all 3 stone types ([item=aoe-stones-igneous], [item=aoe-stones-sedimentary] and [item=aoe-stones-metamorphic]) equally or melt [item=stone] down to [fluid=aoe-lava] using the [entity=aoe-melter] and cool it down using the [entity=aoe-freezer] to turn them all into [item=aoe-stones-igneous]. No matter the initial method, you can use various machines like the [entity=aoe-sedimenter] or [entity=aoe-high-pressure-heater] to switch between the stone types depending on your need.\n\nClose to reaching Age 3, you can breed your first animal: [item=raw-fish]. Animal breeding works pretty much exactly like plant breeding, with one exception. Certain recipes like the ones getting [item=aoe-fish-eggs] have a certain low percentage killing the worst animal module in the machine on completion. See recipe description to see the respective percentages.
